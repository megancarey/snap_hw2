Welcome to the second week of class.
Today you will work in groups of two. Please answer questions in succinct words.
Assignment is:
1) In each group, one person will fork this repository
2) Add your partner as a collaborator
3) Answer questions on this txt separately on separate machines (This will require both students separately pulling the forked repository)
4) Add this file, commit and push
5) Make a pull request

Person A's Name: Megan Carey

Question for A:
1) What does git clone do?
The command git clone copies a repository into a new directory, creates tracking branches for the branches in the copy of the repository, and checks out a branch that corresponds with the active branch in the original repository.

2) What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a version of a project or repository that is stored within a network or on the Internet.

Question for B:
1) Why is version-control framework such as git important?
It's important because it lets you update your code while keeping older versions, and it lets you collaborate on projects with others.

2) Explain the concept of branching in git
Branching allows you to make changes to the code without changing the master branch, which contains the actual live code.
